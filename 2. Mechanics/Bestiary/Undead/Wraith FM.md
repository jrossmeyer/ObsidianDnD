- [Sunlight Weakness, "While in dim light or darkness, the shadow can take the Hide action as a bonus action."]
- [Agonizing Phasing, "The wraith can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The wraith takes 5 (1d10) force damage if they end their turn inside an object. A creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage the first time a wraith passes through them on a turn."]
- [Throes of Oblivion, "When the wraith dies, they collapse inward, creating a burst of painful psychic energy. Each creature within 20 feet of the wraith must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."]

- [Agonizing Touch, "Melee Spell Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (4d6) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be dazed (save ends at end of turn). Each time a target dazed in this way fails a saving throw to end the condition, their hit point maximum is halved. This effect is cumulative, and the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. If a Humanoid dies within 1 minute of being hit by this attack, their spirit rises as a specter under the wraith’s control in an unoccupied space nearest to where that Humanoid died."]
- [Psychic Enervation, "Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone and be frightened of the wraith for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). While frightened in this way, the target can’t stand up."]

- [Denied Vitality, "When a creature who the wraith can see within 30 feet of them regains hit points, the wraith can attempt to sap the life energy restoring the creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or only regain half the number of hit points they otherwise would regain"]
