- [Dying Gasp, "When the Horror dies, they begin to rupture in a vile explosion of viscera and necrotic energy. The creature who reduced the Horror to 0 hit points can make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to appeal to Elyas’s departing soul (no action required). On a successful check, his soul transforms the explosion and each enemy of the Grave Order within 30 feet of the Horror gains 7 (2d6) temporary hit points. On a failed check (or if no check is made), each creature within 15 feet of the Horror must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 (1d10) acid damage plus 5 (1d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."]

- [Spine Cleaver, "Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage, or 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage against a grappled target."]
- [Bone Hook, "Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 15 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, they are grappled (escape DC 14) and the Horror can pull the target up to 15 feet toward them. Until this grapple ends, the Horror can’t make a Bone Hook attack against another target."]
- [Valor's Death(BA), "Each enemy within 10 feet of the Horror who can hear the Horror must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the Horror for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for them, the creature is immune to the Horror’s Valor’s Death for 24 hours."]
