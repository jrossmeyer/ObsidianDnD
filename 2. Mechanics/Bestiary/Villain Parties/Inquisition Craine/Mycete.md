- [Fungal Growth, "Mycete causes fungi to proliferate from a point she can see within 60 feet of her. Solid surfaces in a 10-foot square centered on that point become difficult terrain, and a creature who enters that area for the first time on a turn or starts their turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn)."]
- [Animate Husks(1/Day), "Mycete animates three rotting zombies, who appear in unoccupied spaces Mycete can see within 30 feet of her. The zombies act immediately after Mycete on the same initiative count and follow her verbal orders. If Mycete dies, the zombies are destroyed."]
- [Spore Eruption(BA), "Mycete destroys a rotting zombie under her control, and the zombie violently erupts with toxic spores. Each enemy within 5 feet of the zombie must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."]
