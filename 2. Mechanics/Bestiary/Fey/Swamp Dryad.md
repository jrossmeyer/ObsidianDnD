actions:  
- [<trait-name>, <trait-description>]
- [Multiattack, "The dryad makes two Slam attacks and uses Entangling Roots, if available."]
- [Slam, "Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success ful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned."]
- ["Entangling Roots (recharge 5-6)", "The dryad chooses a point they can see within 60 feet of them, causing tree roots to pull free of the ground and attack in a 15-foot radius centered on that point. If the dryad is within 5 feet of their tree, the radius of this effect doubles to 30 feet. Each creature in that area must suc ceed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or take 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage and be grappled (escape DC 14). While grappled in this way, a creature is restrained and their flesh begins to harden and turn to wood. At the end of a creature’s third consecutive turn being grappled in this way, they become petrified and turn into a hardwood statue. The petrified condition ends for that crea ture if the dryad uses an action to end it, or if the dryad dies."]
- [Fey Intimidation, "The dryad targets up to five creatures they can see within 30 feet of them. Each target who can see the dryad must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the dryad (save ends at end of turn). If a target succeeds on their saving throw or the effect ends for them, the target is immune to the swamp dryad’s Fey Intimidation for the next 24 hours."]
- [Swamp Medicine (3/Day)(BA), "The dryad touches a creature, who regains 18 (3d8 + 5) hit points. Alternatively, the creature removes one disease or neutralizes one poison afflicting them"]
